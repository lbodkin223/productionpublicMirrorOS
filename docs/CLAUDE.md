# MirrorOS Final Public Mobile App - Claude Manifest

## Project Overview
**MirrorOS Final Public Mobile App v3.0** - React Native/Expo mobile application with comprehensive metrics-aware predictions and advanced Web Search RAG.

## Key Components

### Core Files
- `MirrorOSApp.tsx` - Main React Native application component
- `app.config.js` - Expo configuration with API endpoint settings
- `package.json` - Node dependencies and scripts
- `App.js` - Entry point that renders MirrorOSApp

### Configuration
- **API Endpoint**: `https://yyk4197cr6.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod/api`
- **Platform**: React Native with Expo
- **Target**: iOS/Android mobile devices

## App Architecture

### User Interface
1. **Goal Input**: Text field for user's objective
2. **Context Input**: Background information field
3. **Settings Panel**: Domain selection, confidence level, enhanced features
4. **Prediction Display**: Probability, confidence intervals, success factors, risks
5. **Chain of Thought**: Detailed reasoning breakdown (expandable)

### API Integration v3.0
- **Comprehensive Metrics Backend**: Connects to 60+ metrics extraction system
- **Intelligent Evidence Search**: Backend builds metric-specific search queries for precise statistics
- **Enhanced Prediction Request**: POST to `/predict` with structured prediction_data payload
- **Rich Response Data**: Grounded probability, evidence summary, difficulty adjustments, metric-specific insights
- **Robust Error Handling**: Network failures, API errors, infinite recursion prevention
- **Secure Authentication**: Token-based auth with retry limits and fallback mechanisms

### Key Features v3.0
- **Metrics-Aware Predictions**: Backend extracts 60+ specific metrics (weight, height, GPA, test scores, income, etc.)
- **Intelligent Evidence Grounding**: Searches for precise statistics like "lose 50 pounds success rate" or "6'2\" height dating statistics"
- **Difficulty-Adjusted Predictions**: Accounts for goal difficulty (100+ lb weight loss = harder, high GPA = advantage)
- **Enhanced Visual Feedback**: Success probability with comprehensive factor analysis
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Risk factors and success drivers based on metric-specific evidence
- **Chain of Thought**: Expandable reasoning with animated visualization
- **Confidence Intervals**: Shows probability ranges from Monte Carlo simulations
- **Baseline Comparison**: Compares user odds vs web-searched average person data
- **SI Factors Display**: Shows quantified analysis factors (education ratio, competitiveness, etc.)
- **Advantage Multiplier**: Shows how many times better/worse than average (e.g., "28.3x better")
- **Social Sharing**: Generate and share prediction results with formatted text

## Development Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server with QR code
npx expo start

# Platform-specific builds
npx expo run:ios
npx expo run:android
```

### Production Testing
```bash
# Test with production API
npx expo start --prod
```

## Configuration Variables
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` - Backend API endpoint (defaults to production)
- Demo authentication automatically configured for production use

## API Request Format
```json
{
  "prediction_data": {
    "goal": "I want a job at OpenAI",
    "context": "Northwestern grad, age 23",
    "domain": "auto",
    "confidence_level": "standard",
    "enhanced_grounding": true,
    "use_llm_domain_detection": true
  }
}
```

## Expected Response Format
```json
{
  "probability": 0.18,
  "probability_percent": "18.0%",
  "explanation": "Analysis indicates 18.0% success probability for your goal.",
  "confidence_interval": [0.1, 0.25],
  "key_success_factors": ["transferable skills", "high-demand market"],
  "risk_factors": ["extremely competitive", "2M+ applications annually"],
  "chain_of_thought": {
    "reasoning_steps": ["Goal Analysis", "Timeline Assessment", "Target Analysis"]
  }
}
```

## Recent Updates v3.0 (2025-09-03)

### Major Backend Integration
- ✅ **60+ Metrics Integration**: App now connects to comprehensive metrics extraction system
- ✅ **Metric-Aware Display**: Shows specific extracted metrics (weight, height, GPA, test scores)
- ✅ **Intelligent Evidence**: Backend searches for metric-specific statistics automatically
- ✅ **Difficulty Indicators**: Visual feedback on goal difficulty based on extracted metrics
- ✅ **Enhanced Reasoning**: Chain of thought now includes metric-specific analysis

### Security & Stability Improvements
- ✅ **Infinite Recursion Fix**: Auth retry counter prevents infinite loops
